==  Related Products as a Powerful Marketing Tool ==

Suggesting related products in a WooCommerce store isn’t just a nice-to-have — it’s one of the most effective sales techniques available today. Whether you’re upselling premium items or cross-selling complementary products, displaying related products at key points in the customer journey can significantly increase your average order value and conversion rates.

Just like Amazon’s powerful recommendation engine, WooCommerce product recommendation plugins can act as virtual sales assistants — guiding shoppers by showing them relevant suggestions based on what they're already interested in. This keeps customers engaged and encourages them to explore more, ultimately leading to higher cart totals.

By showing personalized product recommendations on product pages, cart pages, or even during checkout, you can help reduce decision fatigue and build buyer confidence. Customers are more likely to trust your store when they see thoughtful, relevant suggestions, making online shopping faster, easier, and more enjoyable — especially for those who dislike browsing or are short on time.

==  Different Ways to Show Related Product Recommendations on your WooCommerce store ==

WooCommerce Related Products feature is one of the important sales tools available for store owners. "Related products" can be employed on your website in different forms. When built-in features in WooCommerce enable you to showcase related products like upsells and cross-sells, third-party plugins enhance this capability. They can automatically recommend related products and create custom related product suggestions based on the activities of customers on your WooCommerce store. The three main methods to easily display similar product suggestions are:

===Upsells===

These products are shown on the product page as an alternative to the product customers have chosen to purchase. There will be an upgrade of the chosen product either in quality or price thereby persuading the customer to choose the better one. It comes under the default text "you may also like".

===Cross-sells=== 

On contrary to up-sells, cross-sells are displayed on the cart page under the title "you may be interested in".  These products would complement the products currently in the cart. On seeing this customers would feel an urge to buy the complementary products along with the products in their cart thereby selling more products for the store. Notifying customers about phone cases while purchasing a phone would be a perfect example of cross-selling.

===Custom Related Products=== 

Set up and manage custom related products to display on your product pages. Use flexible options like categories, tags, attributes, or specific products to fine-tune the WooCommerce related products shown to your shoppers.
